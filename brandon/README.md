This piece of code is designed to test our knowledge with using tests.

We do this by telling our module_test.js file to require chai initially and then to require to the contents of our greeting.js file by setting our constant as a Greet constructor, which saves a name and a greeting as properties of the constructor. It then tests if the const user is equal to the name property in the Greet constructor that is defined in greeting.js. We then run another test that checks if our greet function is returning a statement saying hello to the name that was passed into it.
